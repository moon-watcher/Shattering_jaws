 *
 * This unit provides advanced sound playback methods through differents Z80 drivers.<br>
 *<br>
 * <b>Z80_DRIVER_PCM</b><br>
 * Single channel 8 bits signed sample driver.<br>
 * It can play a sample (8 bit signed) from 8 Khz up to 32 Khz rate.<br>
 *<br>
 * <b>Z80_DRIVER_2ADPCM</b><br>
 * 2 channels 4 bits ADPCM sample driver.<br>
 * It can mix up to 2 ADCPM samples at a fixed 22050 Hz Khz rate.<br>
 * Address and size of samples have to be 256 bytes boundary.<br>
 *<br>
 * <b>Z80_DRIVER_4PCM</b><br>
 * 4 channels 8 bits signed sample driver with volume support.<br>
 * It can mix up to 4 samples (8 bit signed) at a fixed 16 Khz rate.<br>
 * with volume support (16 levels du to memory limitation).<br>
 * Address and size of samples have to be 256 bytes boundary.<br>
 * The driver does support "cutoff" when mixing so you can use true 8 bits samples :)<br>
 *<br>
 * <b>Z80_DRIVER_MVS</b><br>
 * MVS music player driver.<br>
 *<br>
 * <b>Z80_DRIVER_TFM</b><br>
 * TFM music player driver.<br>
 *<br>
 * <b>Z80_DRIVER_VGM</b><br>
 * VGM music player driver.<br>
 * It supports 1 PCM channel at a fixed 8 Khz and allows to play SFX through the named PCM channel.<br>
 * Written by Sigflup and kubilus1.
 *<br>
 * <b>Z80_DRIVER_XGM</b><br>
 * eXtended VGM music player driver.<br>
 * This driver takes VGM (or XGM) file as input to play music.<br>
 * It supports 4 PCM channels at a fixed 14 Khz and allows to play SFX through PCM with 16 level of priority.<br>
 * The driver is designed to avoid DMA contention when possible (depending CPU load).

 *  Sound synchronization was initially 100% done by Z80 itself using the V-Interrupt but
 *  if the Z80 is stopped right at V-Int time (bus request from 68000 or DMA stall) then
 *  the V-Int can be missed by the Z80 and music timing affected.<br>
 *  To fix that issue and also to offer more flexibility the music timing should now be handled by the 68k.<br>
 *  By default this method is called automatically by SGDK at V-Int time but you can decide to handle sync
 *  manually (see SND_setManualSync_XGM(..) method).<br>
 *  When you are in manual sync you normally should call this method once per frame (in the V-Int callback for instance)
 *  but you are free to play with it to increase or decrease music tempo.<br>
 *  Note that it's better to call this method a bit before (3/4 scanlines should be fine) doing DMA operation for best
 *  main bus contention protection (see #SND_set68KBUSProtection_XGM() and #SND_setForceDelayDMA_XGM() methods).
